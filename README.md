# Hi, Gautam here! 👋

Currently building and scaling infrastructure as a **DevOps-II** at **RingCentral** and a Master's grad in **CSE/AI** from **IIIT Bangalore**.

My primary experience is with **Kubernetes**, **AWS**, **GitOps**, and **IaC**. I currently manage **10+ production clusters** across multiple global regions, maintaining **five 9s system uptime**.

While I focus on infrastructure and reliability, I have a strong development background. I've worked on full-stack projects using **FastAPI**, **Spring Boot**, and **React**, and I enjoy building internal tools using **Python** and **Go** to automate complex workflows.

Before my current role, I contributed to a research project at **ISRO** focused on tracking Atmospheric Rivers, where I worked on extracting and analyzing features from **ECMWF ERA5** climate data.
